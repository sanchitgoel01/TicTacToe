Protocol Design:
This file details all the socket message interactions between
the client and server, as well as how they should be used.
The message names are implemented in lowercase kebab case (e.g. 'message-name').

CLIENT PROTOCOL:
    Incoming:
        - Joined Game: Recieved when the server acknowledges that a client joined a game. Contains gamecode and numPlayers. 
            Also contains error message if there was an error joining the game.
        - Fill-Cell: Recieved when the other player clicks a cell. Contains Row/Col pos, and mark (X or O).
        - End-Game: Recieved when the game is over. Contains data: 0, 1, 2, 3 representing Left Match, X Win, O Win, and Draw respectively.
        - Enable-Turn: Recieved when a player can select their mark.
        - Reset-Game: Recieved when a rematch occurs. Should reset the client's board.
        - Rematch-Requested: Recieved when a rematch has been requested. Should change the rematch button text.

    Outgoing:
        Cell-Clicked: Triggered when a cell is clicked client side. Sends Row/Col pos of the cell that was clicked.
        New-Game: Triggered when a client wants to create a new game.
